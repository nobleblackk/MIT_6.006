PeakFinding problem for 1DArray and 2DArray, which will include Implementation of Binary Search SubSet.

Let us consider a number of arrays, we are representing them in symbols ( a â€” i ), we also assume that all the numbers are positive numbers.
Here position 2 is a peak if and only if b >= a and b >=c.
If you are equal and greater than the elements on left and right side than you are the peak. In case of the edges, you only have to look at only one side.
